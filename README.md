# Home-Automation-Using-Gesture-Sensor

APDS-9960 is a digital Proximity, Gesture, and Ambient light sensor. It is a multipurpose sensor. It is used in various smartphones, robotics, etcâ€¦ to detect gesture, ambient light, and proximity. This sensor gives accurate values for gesture detection.

APDS-9960 device has Proximity sensing engine, Ambient light sensing engine, RGB color sensing engine, and gesture detection module. APDS-9960 is easy to interface with any microcontroller because it uses the I2C communication protocol.
This device has an LED which acts as a source for IR signal. When there is an obstacle or any gesture performed in front of the device, the IR signal generated by the LED or reflected back from the surface of the obstacle. This reflected light is sensed by the photodiodes present on APDS-9960. Based on the properties on this reflected light, factors such as ambient light intensity, the proximity of the object and gesture can be determined.

# Project-Overview

Using this sensor,in this project we are controlling TV,FAN and BULB.
Swipping Left and Right over the sensor will change the menu on LCD display(i.e. which component would oyu like to ON or OFF).
By swipping Up it will ON that element and by swipping Down it will OFF it.

There is also a Automatic Water Leveling system in it which will on the motor iif the water level is below a certain level and also automatically off it after fill the tank.
